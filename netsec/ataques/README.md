## Forms of Cyber Attacks

![](../../.gitbook/assets/imagen%20%28947%29.png)

There are various ways cyber-attacks are carried out depending on the nature of what is being attacked. Some of which include:

###  Phishing Attacks

This form of attack involves an attacker cloning the login page of a website and sharing it with victims in an attempt to steal their login credentials.

###  Malware Attacks

This form of attack involves the creation and distribution of malware. Examples of malware are viruses, trojan horses, network worms, ransomware, etc.

###  SQL/NoSQL Injection

This form of attack is targeted at databases. They attempt to steal or clone the database content of a website, or app if the queries constructed from user input are not properly sanitized.

###  Cross-Site Scripting Attacks

This form of attack involves embedding malicious JavaScript code on websites that do not sanitize user input before rendering. They can be used to steal sensitive data from users and send it to an attacker.

###  DOS/DDOS Attacks

This form of attack seeks to overload a web server by sending more requests than it can handle within a short period of time.

###  Brute-force Attacks

This form of attack involves a user trying every possible combination of passwords for a user account on a website.

###  Man-in-the-middle Attacks \(MITM\)

This form of attack is common in networks and occurs when an attacker intercepts requests sent outside a network. An example of this is an attacker seeing form data being submitted on websites and even changing their values \(the data can include passwords and credit card information\).

###  Zero-day Exploits

This form of attack is a newly discovered, or developed vulnerability for a system, platform, or application that the creator of the software has not had time to patch or fix.

###  Social Engineering Attacks

This form of attack involves an attacker attempting to get access to a system via the users themselves.

###  Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks

This form of attack allows an attacker to perform actions on websites that a user is authenticated on without their consent or knowledge.

###  Insider Threats

This form of attack involves attacking a system with inside help. This could be an employee who decides to destroy a system and not an unknown outside attacker.
