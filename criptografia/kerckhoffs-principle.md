# Kerckhoff’s principle

Kerckhoff’s principle effectively means that a given crypto system can be secure even if all of its component parts are well-known and understood except for the key.

Navajo Code Talkers commonly used substitution ciphers where English characters were replaced with a fixed set of words from the Natives’ language \(this substitution map is the key\). Kerckhoff’s Principle applies here in that the language may be well know \(it wasn’t, but it could have been\) but the key remained secret.

Kerckhoff’s Principle is also relevant to modern cryptographic primitives, like AES. AES’s algorithm is well understood and widely published, but it remains a secure way to encrypt data symmetrically so long as the key remains confidential and accessible to only authorized parties.
