# 3 - Retrieving data from other tables

> This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the techniques you learned in previous labs.
>
>  The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`.
>
>  To solve the lab, perform an [SQL injection UNION](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the `administrator` user.
